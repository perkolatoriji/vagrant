# If you get problems with network adapters in virtualbox, they can just be deleted with the followig commands:

vboxmanage hostonlyif remove "VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter"
vboxmanage hostonlyif remove "VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter #2"

# the vagrant project does recreate them anyway, so they can be safely removed (need admin privileges).
